<h3 align="left">Introduction</h3>

This is an Open-source project.
It comprises of Kenyan developers who have specialized in different stacks.
The founder of this project noticed a lack of authentic Kenyan/African photos in search engines and stock photos platform.
This creates a stumbling block when doing presentations/projects that require one to attach images/photos of black people mostly in PR or marketing campaigns while developing ads,
flyers, brochures etc.
The idea of this project is to come up with a database of authentic African/Kenyan photos where users may download these photos to serve their respective needs
e.g AD campaigns and so on.
The platform will also provide an avenue where local photographers, designers and creatives will upload their authentic African/Kenyan photos and videos to display their skill and the beauty
that the continent has to offer,
This is a comunity driven project comprising of both code and none-coding professionals from various backgrounds who have been brought together by their innate desire for pursuing invention and innovation within the Kenyan market.
