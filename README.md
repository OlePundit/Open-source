This is an Open-source project.
It comprises of Kenyan developers who have specialized in different stacks.
The mastermind behind this project noticed a deficiency/lack of Authentic Kenyan/African photos in search engines.
Especially when doing presentations/projects that require one to attach images/photos of black people mostly in PR or marketing campaigns while developing ads,
flyers, brochures etc.
He Pitched the idea of coming up with a site/app/database where photos mentioned above would be available to users.
The idea of this project is to come up with a database of authentic African/Kenyan photos where users may download these photos to serve their respective needs
e.g AD campaigns and so on.
The platform will also provide an avenue where local photographers will upload their authentic African/Kenyan photos to display their skill and the beauty
that the continent has to offer,
The team building this platform comprises of two sub teams- A front-end team and a Back-end team. We have shared the tasks based on one's area of specialization
